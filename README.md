# CKD-ML-Framework
A hybrid machine learning framework for the early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), using stacking with Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting, Naïve Bayes, and Random Forest. Built in Python with Flask frontend, powered by UCI CKD dataset. Achieves 100% accuracy through feature  ensemble modeling.

# Features
- Predicts CKD using clinical parameters
- Hybrid stacking ensemble model for higher accuracy
- Flask-based full-stack web application
- Clean interface with Tailwind CSS

# Technologies Used
- Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas)
- Flask
- HTML, Tailwind CSS
- UCI CKD Dataset
