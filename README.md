# CKD-ML-Framework
Title: CKD-ML-Framework
Purpose: The framework is designed for the early detection of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD).
Key Aspects of the Project

Machine Learning Techniques:

Utilizes stacking with multiple algorithms:
Decision Tree
Gradient Boosting
NaÃ¯ve Bayes
Random Forest
Implementation:

Developed using Python.
Frontend built with Flask.
Dataset:

Powered by the UCI CKD dataset.

Performance:
Claims to achieve 100% accuracy through feature ensemble modeling.

Features:
Predicts CKD using clinical parameters.
Utilizes a hybrid stacking ensemble model for higher accuracy.
Full-stack web application built on Flask.
Clean interface designed with Tailwind CSS.
